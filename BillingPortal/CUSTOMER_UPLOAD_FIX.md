# CUSTOMER UPLOAD DOUBLE-CLICK FIX

## 🐛 Problem Identified
When customers tried to upload documents from the customer portal:
- Selecting a document for the first time would reopen the file picker
- Users had to select the document twice before upload would proceed
- This created a poor user experience and confusion

## 🔍 Root Cause
**Conflicting Event Handlers**: The upload functionality had two separate click handlers that both triggered the file picker:

### 1. Inline onclick Attribute (HTML)
```html
<button class="btn btn-primary" onclick="document.getElementById('file-input').click()">
    Choose Files
</button>
```

### 2. Event Listener (JavaScript)
```javascript
uploadArea.addEventListener('click', () => fileInput.click());
```

### The Problem Flow:
1. User clicks "Choose Files" button
2. **First trigger**: `onclick` attribute opens file picker
3. **Second trigger**: Click event bubbles up to `uploadArea`, opening file picker again
4. User sees file picker close and reopen
5. User must select file again for upload to work

## ✅ Solution Applied

### 1. Removed Inline onclick Attribute
**Before:**
```html
<button class="btn btn-primary" onclick="document.getElementById('file-input').click()">
    Choose Files
</button>
```

**After:**
```html
<button class="btn btn-primary" id="choose-files-btn">
    Choose Files
</button>
```

### 2. Enhanced JavaScript Event Handling
**Before:**
```javascript
// Click to upload
uploadArea.addEventListener('click', () => fileInput.click());
```

**After:**
```javascript
// Button click to upload (prevent event bubbling)
chooseFilesBtn.addEventListener('click', (e) => {
    e.stopPropagation(); // Prevent bubbling to uploadArea
    fileInput.click();
});

// Click anywhere in upload area (except button) to upload
uploadArea.addEventListener('click', (e) => {
    // Only trigger if not clicking the button
    if (e.target !== chooseFilesBtn && !chooseFilesBtn.contains(e.target)) {
        fileInput.click();
    }
});
```

## 🎯 How It Works Now

### Single Click Upload Process:
1. **User clicks "Choose Files" button**
   - `e.stopPropagation()` prevents event bubbling
   - File picker opens once
   - User selects file(s)
   - Upload proceeds immediately

2. **User clicks anywhere else in upload area**
   - Check ensures button wasn't clicked
   - File picker opens once
   - Upload works as expected

3. **Drag & Drop** (unchanged)
   - Still works perfectly
   - No conflicts with click handlers
